## Objective (Purpose) :

The purpose of this document is to outline the software requirements for the development of a Child Health and Vaccination Management System.

## Scope :

The system aims to provide parents with a comprehensive platform for managing their child's health, including vaccination scheduling, online consultations, diet planning, and information about different diseases.It includes various features like vaccination slot booking (Parents can schedule vaccination appointments for their children through the online platform) ,reminders,online consulting,health records (Parents and healthcare providers can access and update health records as needed),user-friendly interface, Diet Plan Management.

## Definition :

## Functional Requirements :

Vaccination Slot Booking:
Parents will be able to schedule vaccination appointments for their children.
The system will provide a calendar view for available vaccination slots.

Reminders:
Automated reminders will be sent to parents leading up to schedule vaccinations.

Online Consulting:
Healthcare professionals will be able to conduct secure video calls or chat consultations.
Appointment scheduling for online consultations will be available.

Diet Plan:
Parents will have access to view and follow diet plans for their children.

Disease Information:
-Information on various diseases, especially those preventable through vaccination, will be available.
-The system will include a search functionality for disease information.

Health Records:
-Parents and healthcare providers will be able to access and update digital health records.
-The system will maintain a comprehensive vaccination history for each child.

Security and Privacy:
-The system will implement secure user authentication for parents and healthcare providers.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance Requirements:
-The system will load and display critical pages within 2 seconds under normal operating conditions.
-The system will support a minimum of 1000 concurrent users during peak times without significant degradation of performance.

Scalability:
-The architecture will allow for easy scalability to accommodate an increase in the user base or data volume.
-The system will handle a growth rate of at least 20% in terms of users and data annually.

Availability:
-The system will have an uptime of at least 99.5% excluding scheduled maintenance periods.
-Scheduled maintenance will occur during off-peak hours, and users will be notified in advance.

Reliability:
-The system will be capable of handling unexpected failures gracefully, with minimal impact on users.
-The Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) will be at least 500 hours.

Security:
-The system will undergo regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
-Access to sensitive information will be logged and monitored for unauthorized access.

### Security

- The system should undergo regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- Access to sensitive information should be logged and monitored for unauthorized access.
- There will be a authentication process during registration.

### Reliability

Continous updates are matained , continous Adminstration is done to keep system operational.
During peak hours system will maintain same user experaince by managing load balacning .

### Availability

Uptime: 24\*7 available, 99.999%

### Maintainability:

A database software will be used to maintain System data Persistence.
IT operations team will easily monitor and configure System using Adminstrative tools provided by Servers.
Separate enviornment will be maintained for system for isolation in production, testing, and development.

### Portablility:

PDA: Portable Device Application
Portable divice application system will be provided portable user interface through users will be able to access online web based system.
System can be deployed to single server, multi server, to any OS, Cloud (Azure or AWS or GCP).

### Accessibility:

only parents and hospital will be able to login on website after authentication.

### Durability:

The system will maintain child details.
The system will implement backup and recovery for retaining data over the time.
The system will use cache for faster data retrieval and improved performance.

### Efficiency:

Maximum number of parents can login to website at same time.
The system architecture should be scalable to handle an increasing number of users and data.
System will be able to manage load.

### Modularity:

System will designed and developed using reusable, independent senarios in the form of modules.
These modules will be loosely coupled and highly cohesive.

### Scalability:

The system will provide a consistent user experience to users irrespective of load.

### Safety:

-All user data, especially health records and personally identifiable information (PII), should be encrypted during transmission and storage.
-Establish a data recovery plan to restore information in case of accidental deletion, system failure, or other emergencies.
-Maintain detailed audit trails for user activities, especially those involving access to health records.
-Ensure that users only have access to the data necessary for their roles.
